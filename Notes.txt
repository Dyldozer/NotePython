I can help you create a script that converts dates in your specific format. Here's a simple Python script that will do the job:

```python
import re
import datetime

def convert_date_format(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        content = file.readlines()
    
    converted_content = []
    for line in content:
        # Check if the line contains ~~~~yyMMdd-HHmmss~~~~
        match = re.search(r'~~~~(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})-(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})~~~~', line)
        if match:
            # Extract date components
            yy, MM, dd, HH, mm, ss = match.groups()
            
            # Create the new format ~~~~MM/dd/yy-HH:mm~~~~
            new_format = f"~~~~{MM}/{dd}/{yy}-{HH}:{mm}~~~~"
            
            # Replace the old format with the new one
            line = re.sub(r'~~~~\d{6}-\d{6}~~~~', new_format, line)
        
        converted_content.append(line)
    
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines(converted_content)
    
    print(f"Conversion complete. Output saved to {output_file}")

# Example usage
input_file = "your_input_file.txt"
output_file = "converted_file.txt"
convert_date_format(input_file, output_file)
```

Would you like me to explain how this script works?
