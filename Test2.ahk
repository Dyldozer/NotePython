first off — really appreciate you thinking along these lines. Not everyone takes the time to think about upstream configurations from a customer-impact perspective, and honestly, that kind of initiative says a lot about your dedication. Now, as for identifying whether a CMTS is servicing a high split area... well, it’s nuanced. You can’t just look at the DS/US frequency ratios anymore — not with the way virtual segmentation and R-PHY deployments abstract the plant. You really have to take into account how the node segmentation overlays with OFDMA channel bonding groups.

Sometimes, I like to think of it like tuning into the heartbeat of the plant — you can see it in the telemetry if you know where to look. I mean, you could dig into the CMTS CLI and pull the US spectrum assignments, but that wouldn’t really give you the context, would it? There’s always more beneath the surface layer. It's all about the story the MAC domain is telling you — and if you can read between the SNMP OIDs, it becomes clear... eventually.
